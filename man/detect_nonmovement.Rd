\arguments{
\item{binfile}{Text lines read from an open connection to a bin file.}

\item{binfile_path}{Path to the bin file to be processed.}

\item{output_folder}{Path to the folder containing GENEAcore run outputs and Measurement Period Information (MPI) files.}

\item{still_seconds}{The number of seconds included in the rolling standard
deviation calculation for stillness to determine the shortest detection duration.}

\item{sd_threshold}{The threshold applied to the rolling standard deviation
of combined acceleration to determine stillness.}

\item{temp_seconds}{The number of seconds included in the rolling temperature
difference calculation or non-wear which also determines the shortest detection duration.}

\item{border_seconds}{The minimum number of seconds of a still event to be classed as a new bout.}

\item{long_still_seconds}{The minimum number of seconds of a still bout that is classed as non-wear.}

\item{delta_temp_threshold}{The threshold applied to the rolling temperature difference to determine non-wear.}

\item{posture_changes_max}{The maximum number of adjoining events that make up a single bout.}

\item{non_move_duration_max}{The maximum number of seconds of a still bout to be classed as non-movement.
Still bouts with a duration longer than this number is automatically classed as non-wear.}
}
\value{
List of sphere points, non-movement bouts and non-wear events.
