\description{
Sample Bin File
}
\details{
Function to read in a GENEActiv bin file with option to downsample
to 1Hz. This can read the whole of the file or just a portion of it by
setting the start_time and end_time parameters.
}
\examples{
binfile_path <- system.file("extdata/20Hz_file.bin", package = "GENEAcore")
output_folder <- tempdir()
con <- file(binfile_path, "r")
binfile <- readLines(con, skipNul = TRUE)
close(con)
measurements <- sample_binfile(binfile, binfile_path, output_folder)
